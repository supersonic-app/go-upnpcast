# go-upnpcast

**Status**: In development. This library is functional but not API stable.

Go library for casting media to uPnP/DLNA devices.

This code originates as an extraction and refactoring of the uPnP/DLNA backend of [Go2TV](https://github.com/alexballas/go2tv) by Alex Ballas.

See the example in the `cmd` directory.
